Resume Recommendation System with AI Chatbot

This project is a Resume Recommendation System powered by an AI chatbot that helps generate relevant resumes based on specific requirements. The model is trained on a dataset of resumes, and the chatbot responds to queries by providing the most suitable resumes for a given role and experience level.

Project Overview

The system uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to train a model on a large set of resumes. Once trained, the AI chatbot can take input from the user, such as job titles (e.g., "Python Developer") and required experience levels, and provide a relevant resume from the dataset.

Key Features:
Resume Dataset: The dataset consists of resumes across various roles like Python Developer, Data Scientist, etc.
AI Chatbot: The chatbot is designed to take job-related queries from the user (e.g., job title, experience, skills required).
Resume Generation: Based on user input, the chatbot will provide a resume that matches the role and experience level specified.
Dataset

The model has been trained on a dataset consisting of resumes from various industries and roles. The data includes information such as:

Job Title
Skills
Experience Level
Educational Qualifications
Career Objective
